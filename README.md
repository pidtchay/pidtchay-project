# About project

This is a project in which I can learn many professional methods that are used in the "real world".

I am going to make a demo application. Where in different modules will be implemented with which the user can interact.

TODO:
* Use Ant Design components to reduce page layout time. In the future, I am going to develop my components.
* Make an authorization page. For starters, it will be just a form with fields to fill out and a simple authorization mechanism. The display of other sections of the application will depend on whether the user is authorized.
* Welcome homepage. On the left there will be a component "thermometer" with an arbitrary list. Help block with free text.
* Make a module for viewing information on Github repositories. On one page there will be a table with a list of repositories belonging to the selected company. By clicking on the repository ID, a detailed view form will open.
* Own implementation of internationalization.
* Add tests for components.
* Make the module "Shopping Cart". Information about the goods in the basket, total amount, details.

The list will expand as new ideas emerge.
